# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Linguistic Features, Emoticons and Emoji

This project is for the coursework of CSCI-UA.0480 Special Topics- Natural Language Processing

## Abstract
SemEval has served as a leading forum in the field of sentiment analysis. Our system is based on the Twitter Sentiment Analysis task offered in SemEval 2017 and SemEval 2013 forums. The system uses rich linguistic, emoticon-emoji based features to detect positive, negative or neutral sen- timent of a tweet. Our system includes features developed in earlier systems and new features cre- ated by our team. We introduce features based on adjective and adverb unigrams, emoticons and emoji and develop new lexicon based features based on popular sentiment lexicons. Based on these elements, we developed an SVM trained sys- tem that achieved a macro f-score of 64.9 and 63.8 on the SemEval 2013 and SemEval 2017 datasets respectively. These results would place our sys- tem in top 4 at SemEval 2013 and top 8 at Se- mEval 2017 forums.
